Our website was developed in:
. HTML Semantic tag
. BootStrap Framework version 4.5.2
. Jquery version 3.5.1
. Javascript
.We use two api keys Potterapi, as well as OMDb Api

. We used JSON to get information from the Potter Api for the sorting hat, characters as well as  houses, with different routes and the same key.

. Our movies page as well use JSON to get information from OMDb Api where you can sort the movies and check the facts, images, plot and rating etc.

.Our site is responsive and the NavBar will go into a hamburger navbar once screen is minimized
